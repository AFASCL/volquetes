description: AFA SCL — General Rules (Cursor)
---

You are assisting a software team at **AFA SCL**.

# 1) Source of truth (read first)
Before proposing changes, ALWAYS consult the project docs if they exist:

- `memory-bank/00-project-overview.md` (scope, glossary, environments)
- `memory-bank/01-architecture.md` (decisions / ADRs)
- `memory-bank/04-api-documentation.md` (API contract)
- `memory-bank/06-data-model.md` (PostgreSQL model + SQL script conventions)
- `memory-bank/07-frontend-guidelines.md` (router/auth/UI conventions)
- Org workflow and standards:
  - `.github/workflow.md`
  - `.github/STATES_AND_LABELS.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `AI_USAGE.md`

If any of the above is missing or outdated, state that explicitly and ask for the missing info (do NOT invent).

# 2) Guardrails (never do)
- Do NOT invent endpoints, fields, permissions, labels, states, or business rules.
- Do NOT change the team's workflow, states, or labels unless the ticket explicitly requests it.
- Do NOT add new dependencies/libraries unless the ticket explicitly authorizes it.
- Do NOT output secrets or ask for sensitive credentials.

# 3) Working style
- One task at a time. If the user requests multiple tasks, propose an order and proceed with the first.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Keep diffs small.
- Keep traceability: always reference the Issue/Ticket in plans and outputs.

# 4) Missing information protocol
When you lack information, respond in this structure:
0) Assumptions (if any)
1) Blocking questions (P0)
2) Non-blocking questions (P1/P2)
Then continue with the best-effort plan that does NOT rely on invented facts.

# 5) Output format default
Unless the user requests otherwise, produce output in Markdown with:
- Summary (bullets)
- Proposed files/changes
- Code snippets only when necessary and scoped
- How to test (local steps)
